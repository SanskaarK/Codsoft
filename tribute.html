        <h3>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</h3>
        <h4>(1924-2018)</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a towering figure in Indian politics. He was a poet, a statesman, and a leader who
            inspired millions of people. He served as Prime Minister of India for three terms, and during his time in
            office, he made significant contributions to the country's development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vajpayee was born in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, in 1924. He was a brilliant student, and he went on to study
            at the University of Delhi, where he earned a degree in political science. After graduating, he joined the
            Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a political party that later became the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
        </p>
        <p>
            Vajpayee served in various ministerial positions in the government of Prime Minister Morarji Desai in the
            1970s. He was also the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, from 1984
            to 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1996, Vajpayee led the BJP to victory in the general election, and he became Prime Minister of India. He
            was the first non-Congress leader to form a majority government in India since 1984.
        </p>
        <p>
            During his first term as Prime Minister, Vajpayee made significant progress on a number of fronts. He
            launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, a program to build rural roads. He also initiated the Sarva
            Shiksha Abhiyan, a program to provide universal elementary education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vajpayee also played a key role in improving relations between India and Pakistan. In 1998, he oversaw the
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests, which led to a temporary setback in relations between the two countries. However,
            he also worked to build bridges with Pakistan, and in 2001, he visited the country for the first time by an
            Indian Prime Minister in over 20 years.
        <p>
            Vajpayee's second term as Prime Minister was cut short by the 2004 general election, in which the BJP lost
            to the Congress Party. However, he remained a respected figure in Indian politics, and he continued to be
            active in public life until his death in 2018.
